## How To Launch

Nodejs v4.6.2 and [Meteorjs](https://www.meteor.com/) are required to run this web application. The easiest way to download the correct version of NodeJs is through [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

After those are installed simply navigate to this folder and run the following:

```bash
  npm install #Install node modules
  meteor      #Install and launch meteor
```

After the `meteor` command the application should be accessible from [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
